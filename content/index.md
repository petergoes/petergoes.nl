## About me

Hi there, welcome. My name is Peter Goes, and I am an Amsterdam (The Netherlands) based web developer. I get exited about all things created with web technologies. Whether it is a clean user interface, a clever Node.JS back-end implementation or geeking out on JavaScipt on Raspberry Pi's, chances are that I want to wrap my head around it.

At the moment I work as a Front-End Developer at <a href="https://www.decorrespondent.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">De Correspondent</a> in Amsterdam. I get to play with the latest web technologies, which I think is super exciting!
	
I use this place to experiment with (new) web technologies and like to see it as my personal home on the web. Take a look around, and tell me what you think about it!

## About the site

The site is completely static. Quite recently I refactored it from a completely custom build gulp pipeline over to <a href="https://11ty.dev" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Eleventy</a>.  
Having spent some time with Eleventy, I came to really like it! Because my old stack was using Markdown as content anyway, the transition was pretty straight forward. Because of the switch, I can make overview pages with much more ease now. And as a result, the blogposts have their own [RSS feed now](/blog/feed.xml)!

As the site progress, I'll write more about how it is set up. Like adding a demo viewer so you can see all components that are used to build the site. To start things off, here is the <a href="/typo-test" target="_self">typography test page</a>. Ow, and the font you are looking at? That is <a href="https://ia.net/writer/blog/a-typographic-christmas">iA Writer Duo</a> for the body type and  <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a> for the code examples.
