## About me

Hi there, welcome. My name is Peter Goes, and I am an Amsterdam (The Netherlands) based web developer. I get exited about all things created with web technologies. Whether it is a clean user interface, a clever Node.JS back-end implementation or geeking out on JavaScipt on Raspberry Pi's, chances are that I want to wrap my head around it.

At the moment I work as a Front-End Developer at <a href="http://www.voorhoede.nl" target="_blank">De Voorhoede</a> in Amsterdam. I get to play with the latest web technologies, which I think is super exiting!
	
I use this place to experiment with (new) web technologies and like to see it as my personal home on the web. Take a look around, and tell me what you think about it!

## About the site

The site is completely static. I started out using the static site generator <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank">Hexo</a>, thinking it would get me up and running quickly. But the more I use it, the more I feel that it is just to much overhead. The gulp file I wrote to let it do what I want is already to big anyway. So I could just as well ditch the whole framework and do it myself.

As the site progress, I'll write more about how it is set up. Like adding a demo viewer so you can see all components that are used to build the site. To start things off, here is the <a href="/typo-test" target="_self">typography test page</a>. Ow, and the font you are looking at? That is <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode" target="_blank">Fira Code</a>.
