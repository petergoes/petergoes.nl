This site is committed to providing an experience that functions for the widest
possible audience, regardless of technology or ability.

It strives to conform to level [AA compliance for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). These are guidelines that explain how to make web
content easier to use for disabled people.

The code used on this site is [standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://www.w3.org/standards/). 
Any person using a past, present, or future browser that honors these standards
should be capable of navigating this site.

In addition to being tested on modern browsers, this site has been checked for
screen reader ease of use using [Voice Over](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/).
It is also audited using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) and [axe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd).

Issues with this site’s accessibility can be submitted as a [Git Hub issue](https://github.com/petergoes/petergoes.nl/issues), or by using the [contact form](/contact). I take
these issues very seriously and will try to remedy the problem as quickly as
time allows.

Although I cannot guarantee that all content linked to, or embedded on this site
is fully accessible, I try to choose sites and services that embrace
[Inclusive Design principles](http://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/).

This statement is an adaptation of the one [Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.design/)
wrote on his website. Which can be found [here](https://ericwbailey.design/accessibility-statement/).
