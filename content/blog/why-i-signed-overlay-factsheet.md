Today I submitted the [PR](https://github.com/karlgroves/overlayfactsheet/pull/113)
to sign the [Overlay Fact Sheet](https://overlayfactsheet.com/). I did not do

> Accessibility on the Web is a big challenge, both for owners of websites and 
> for the users of those websites. The invention of novel approaches to 
> resolving this challenge is to be commended. However, in the case of overlays 
> - especially those which attempt to add widgets that present assistive

> implementing their product will give their customer's sites immediate 
> compliance with laws and standards.
>
> No overlay product on the market can cause a website to become fully compliant
> with any existing accessibility standard and therefore cannot eliminate legal
