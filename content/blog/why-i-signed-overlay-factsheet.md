Today I submitted the [PR](https://github.com/karlgroves/overlayfactsheet/pull/113)
to sign the [Overlay Fact Sheet](https://overlayfactsheet.com/). I did not do
this lightly. In this post, I explain why I did.

## What the factsheet is all about

To quote the conclusion of the Overlay Factsheet:

> Accessibility on the Web is a big challenge, both for owners of websites and 
> for the users of those websites. The invention of novel approaches to 
> resolving this challenge is to be commended. However, in the case of overlays 
>
> * especially those which attempt to add widgets that present assistive 
>   features - the challenge is not being met. Even more problematic are the 
>   deceptive marketing provided by some overlay vendors who promise that 
>   implementing their product will give their customer's sites immediate 
>   compliance with laws and standards.
>
> No overlay product on the market can cause a website to become fully compliant
> with any existing accessibility standard and therefore cannot eliminate legal
> risk.

## Why I signed

I view front-end development as a **craft**. I take pride in code that is readable and maintainable, in interfaces that make sense to its users. I try my best to become good in what I do. It takes commitment and dedication to reach that. And like with anything that takes dedication to master, a good front-end is not cheap.

Front-end development is not a matter of ticking boxes, or putting  colour onto various elements. You should be able to look past your own experiences, think about someone else; the user of your work, the browser that user is using and the context in which the user is operating.

A part of the code that we write can be automatically checked and fixed. But for a pretty big portion that is not an option. It is the human part of our work. Our ability to research how our users interact with our product, translate that into a _good_ and _accessible_ user interface, can never be automated. Because making your product accessible, comes down to building it so that it **makes sense to your user**. That is, by definition, subjective. And computers can not make choices in subjective matters.

Therefore, tools that promise to make a website accessible with a single line of code, can **never** fix issues that **require** human thinking.

When they _do_ make that promise, they false advertise.  
And degrading the craft of front-end development with it.
