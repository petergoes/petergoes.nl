## My journey to become a better front-end developer

For a long time now I try to keep up with all the latest developments in our
front-end community. Learning React, a bit of Vue, diving into ES6,7,... You 
know, like the rest of us.

Learning about all these frameworks, build tools and the like, I get 
the feeling of missing out on a more important part of our trade. Because the 
ultimate goal we all strive for, is to deliver a superb experience to our users.
And we do that by shipping HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a bunch of images. There is 
still much to learn about those fundamental parts of the web. And that is where 
I will focus my attention on.

And although I know these parts reasonably well, there is always room for 
improvement. I want to get a deep an thorough understanding of these parts, 
before I learn something that is build on top of that foundation.

I am going to approach this project like so:

**Phase 1: Lay the foundation**
* A deeper foundational understanding of _JavaScript_
* Get pretty intimate with _CSS_
* Become really close friends with _HTML_

**Phase 2: Build the walls**
* Brick by brick, _Progressive Enhancement_ as a second nature
* Preparing for the storm with _Progressive Web Apps_
* Move things around with _Animations_

**Phase 3: Put on the roof**
* Connect all the wires with _HTTP_

These are by no means set in stone (this is what first came to mind) but for now
it is my guide on this journey
