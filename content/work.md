## Work

This is a (small) list of some projects I have worked on. To give a little 
insight in the work I do. These are side projects. I build them mainly because
I like to experiment with some technology / framework, or I feel the need to 
automate something in my day to day work.

This is not a full list, but some i'd like to highlight.

### `json-mock-api`: Mock an api with plain json files.
This simple CLI tool allows you to turn a folder of static json files into a
mock api server.

I wanted a small tool which turned a folder of json files into a mock api
with a single command. All other solutions that I found either did to much, or
had a complex setup. This tool does exactly what I want it to do. Namely turning
json files via their folder structure in a REST API

It also provided me with the experiance of building a CLI tool and releasing 
something to NPM
